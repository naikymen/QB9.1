QB9.1 PTMs
This repo contains the scripts I made to extract PTMs from a .xml.gz SwissProt-Uniprot database file.
They use SQLalchemy to create and clean the database, stored in SQLite format.
Execute in order, starting by the deglarePTMdb.py script.

Disclaimer: it may not be pretty, nor well documented :)
